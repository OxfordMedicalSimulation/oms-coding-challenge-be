# OMS Coding Challenge

Welcome to the OMS coding challenge for .net developers. This challenge is intended to be undertaken real time during your technical interview with the team.

All candidates are free to clone the repository and take a look prior to their technical interview. 

During the interview you will be asked to share your screen and solve the TODOs, talking the team through it as you go.

You are free to use the IDE of your choice (Rider, Visual Studio, etc).

The purpose of the exercise is for candidates to show an understanding of .net development and to create some discussion points for your technical interview. It is considered an "open book" exercise so don't worry if you find yourself looking something up.

# About the project

The OMS team are on a virtual tour of the UK. This 1,786km tour takes in many of the places our employees live. Any active mode of travel counts towards the challenge including walking, running, cycling, swimming, rowing, kayaking or anything else you can think of.

You will be contributing towards a web API for collecting and reporting on data from the tour.

The API is a .net 6 Web Api using EF Core, a SQLite database and Xunit.

There are a number of TODOs throughout the code. They are numbered but it is not mandatory to complete all of them or stick strictly to the order (although in some cases they refer back to a previous item).

Good luck!

The OMS dev team.
